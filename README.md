# 📘 Linear Regression: Hours Studied vs. Exam Score

A simple example of **linear regression using Python and scikit-learn**.  
This project demonstrates how to train a regression model to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours studied.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project walks through an end-to-end machine learning workflow:
1. Prepare a dataset (`Hours_Studied` → `Score`)
2. Split the data into training and testing sets
3. Train a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
4. Make predictions and evaluate model accuracy
5. Visualize the regression line against actual data points
